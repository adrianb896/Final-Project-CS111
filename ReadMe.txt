In my final project, the data I plan to work with will involve Formula 1 2020 Driver Standings that has to deal with a total of 21 drivers. The summary analyses I plan to perfom will be mainly focusing on the Grand Prix points won by specific teams during the 2020 season at several locations as the season continues. Since races are going on right now, I also plan on implementing updated file data that will be supported by the drivers postion they are currently in and the total amount of points they have throughout these next week of last races. These type of queries will help me to compare points that have to deal with what Formula 1 team has the most amount of points and what team has the least amount of points. As well as looking at the average amount of points being won by the overall spectrum of the 10 teams. I also plan to support my data of the 21 drivers with another query that the user will be given the option to look at if they desire to. A total of 15 races have happened in 2020 season.

Changes that I made during my first progress update was making seperate output functions for the option layout in the main function. Since I originally just had it in one output statement, I needed to realize that organizing it in more than one output statment will help the user or collaborator to better understand my program. The sorting criteria that is included in my "input.dat" file is accordingly organzied to describe the position each driver is in, their names, the team each driver is on, and the amount of points they recieve throughout the 2020 season. These points will updated twice since their are only 2 races left in the season due to COVID protocals and restrictions. Summary analyses that were performed was figuring out how i am going to be writing my code for the next upcoming days. I decided on writing either switch statements or conditional statements in order for the users to decide what option they would like to choose from as well as a lot of while loops so it can ask what options they want to choose from again.

Some updates I made to my program was figurinng out how to create functions in order to erase a desired name by the user. Another thing that was updated was the options menu list-since the reqiurements wants us take an element and remove it from the array that it is currently in. Also to add a new element into the array by inserting a desired drivers position, name, team, and points. I am capable of doing it all in the main but since we have to have seperate files then this makes another challenge; which is having to call these functions into the main in order for them to print depending on the option you choose. My method was to create a swtich statment to display what ever the user desires to display based upon my Option List menu. 

[P r o j e c t - R e p o r t]:
Throughout my project I have been able to accomplish how to display data from the "input.dat" file in a list format by including the "iomanip" function, how to display only one driver by creating a function to search for a driver, how to display every driver by calling for the "input.dat" file, erasing a driver by going into the "input.dat" file and stopping the array at a certain point, adding a new driver into my array by the users desired input, showing who had the highest and lowest amount of points by comparing each driver, and displaying the average amount of points accumulated throughout the 2020 season by creating a "double" function. My approach going into this project was learning how to create seperate functions for each data I was going to be working with that was included in my "Struct" parameter. Theses variables were to be used so I can accomplish the result of being able to use the options that were listed above. By creating seperate functions for each option that I wanted to use, I was able to implement this into my "library.cpp" file and also create a list of function prototypes in the "library.h" file. Being able to organize my functions into different files will help me in the near future to keep being clean and proficient if I ever need to work with other coders. Another approach I took was creating a "switch-case statment" in order to locate and identify what option the user has chosen. This method essentially allowed me to call my functions from my "library.h" file and implement them in my "main.cpp" file and into my "switch-case statement". I took this type of approach mainly because of how organized it looks and if someone was to look at my code for the first time, they would be able to understand how it all connects well. This type of approach can also be compared to "conditional statements" like "if" and "else" method since I am waiting for the user to choose from my "Option Menu." Once they choose an option, then the "switch-case statement" will start to do its magic.   
[P.S]: I appreciate how much CS 111 has helped me discover things I never would've imagined I would be doing especially things like working with specific data and creating files for this data in C++ language. I also want to give thanks to my Professor and TA for helping and giving me great advice throughout this semester. The resources and knowledge given throughout this course is something I will never take for granted. Thank you to everyone who took the time and looked at my code and project. Cheers.
